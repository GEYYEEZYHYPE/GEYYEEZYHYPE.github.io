     Chemical Energy and Fossil Fuels
<p> Lets start with chemical energy, have you ever thought what energy goes into my food? You probably thought protein,
fat, carbohydrates. But the energy stored in your food is chemical energy. Thats right, chemical energy. Chemical energy
can also be gasoline or even batteries. In things like homous, bread, pasta there is chemical energy. Moving onto fossil
fuels they make coal, methane, natural gas and petroleum. People say fossil fuels are bad, because they produce air pollu-
tants which makes carbon monoxide (which is poisonous) and sulfur dioxide (which can make acid) but that happens only to
burnt fossil fuels. The three main fossil fuels are coal, petroleum and natural gas. Lets say you go to the beach and die you are sunk to
the bottom. Then you get buried by sand which applies pressure on you, your weaker parts of the body are turned into oil and your stronger
parts turn into coal. Things like coal contains a lot of carbon a type called anthracite contains 97% carbon.

can also be good, because they produce a ton of energy. If there was no fossil fuels there would be no petroleum (petrol) which means you will have to
find a different source to fill up cars, rockets, planes and nearly every method of transport.
