        Part 1 <br>
        Introduction

<p> Every single thing you do, requires energy. There are many types of energy-sound, thermal, chemical, kinetic- There
are also some fuels such as fossil fuels. When you have a jog, get out of your bed or even walk that requires energy.
Have you ever wondered, what type of energy is in a windmill, what type of energy is in heat or even what type of
energy is in your food? Well you are going to find out.

     Chemical Energy and Fossil Fuels
<p> Lets start with chemical energy, have you ever thought what energy goes into my food? You probably thought protein,
fat, carbohydrates. But the energy stored in your food is chemical energy. Thats right, chemical energy. Chemical energy
can also be gasoline or even batteries. In things like homous, bread, pasta there is chemical energy. Moving onto fossil
fuels they make coal, methane, natural gas and petroleum. People say fossil fuels are bad, because they produce air pollu-
tants which makes carbon monoxide (which is poisonous) and sulfur dioxide (which can make acid) but that happens only to
burnt fossil fuels. The three main fossil fuels are coal, petroleum and natural gas. Lets say you go to the beach and die you are sunk to
the bottom. Then you get buried by sand which applies pressure on you, your weaker parts of the body are turned into oil and your stronger
parts turn into coal. Things like coal contains a lot of carbon a type called anthracite contains 97% carbon.

can also be good, because they produce a ton of energy. If there was no fossil fuels there would be no petroleum (petrol) which means you will have to
find a different source to fill up cars, rockets, planes and nearly every method of transport.

                Kinetic and Elastic Energy

              <a href="Index.html" target="_blank">Visit the quiz</a>
  <p> Both sorts of energies, are related to movement. We will start with elastic energy, when you pull an elastic band and you let go and then it swings it
produces elastic energy. In archery, when you pull the bow towards you and then release it, the energy released is elastic
 energy. If you take a toy car, pull it towards you and then release it and it just zooms past you it releases elastic energy. 
  <img src="images/Slingshot.png"height=250 width=250></img>
<p> The image shows a slingshot, which shows the steps of elastic energy. A bow and slingshot are both perfect examples of elastic energy. You pull it towards
you and then you release it and the energy is elastic energy. Elastic energy is also renewable. Moving onto kinetic energy, kinetic energy is similar to ela-
stic energy. You know when sometimes you pass by a windmill, well you may be wondering what energy does a windmill use? Well a windmill actually uses kinetic
energy. A train uses kinetic energy, nearly everything that moves uses kinetic energy.
<img src="images/Kinetic Energy Demonstration.jfif"height=230 width=230></img>
<p> This shows a perfect example of kinetic energy. Lets say you have a basketball, and you drop it. It transforms into kinetic energy like what it shows in the
picture.
            Part 3 <br>
            Solar and Thermal Energy
<p> Those are two types of energies that are very different. Solar energy is energy from the sun, and thermal energy means warm things like radiators, ovens and
way more things. Mostly if there's less energy in the chemical store there is more energy in the thermal store. To cook food you need thermal energy. Some of you
might think but you said chemical energy. The food itself is chemical energy but what you use to cook your food is thermal energy. Solar energy is a form of energy
from the sun, and it has been used to cook food before. Solar energy is totally free and renewable. Unlike other energies sun will never run out. Solar energy is
renewable and thermal energy is non-renewable. Solar energy gets electricity from the sun.

          Part 4 <br>
          Renewable and Non-Renewable 
<p> You are probably wondering, what does renewable mean? Renewable is a type of natural energy. Such as wind, water, biomass and solar these are renewable energies.
How do those renewable energies produce electricity? Well we will start with water energy, water energy gets compressed into a dam. It moves around very slowly, which
is kinetic energy. It moves in a turbine and then turns into electrical energy. The water slows down when it flows but then speeds along the turbine. How do you turn
Biomass into electricity? Well you can burn biomass with steamed up water, to power generators in turbines and can be proccessed into fuel. You might be wondering,
what exactly is biomass? Well its things like plants, crops or anything that is living or has lived.-not animals- What makes water and biomass renewable is you can 
always grow some more biomass when it runs out, and there will pretty much always be water, they are both natural same as renewable energy. We will talk a bit about
what makes solar energy renewable because some parts have already been said on Part 3. You get electricity from the sun in solar energy, it traps the light and 
makes electricity. It lowers your electricity bill, but pannels can be very expensive. Last but not least is wind, is the use of wind to provide mechanical power
through things like wind turbines to turn electric generators or milling or pumping. Windmills, make a large amount of energy.

<p> The diagram shows the windmill and solar pannels and they are both renewable energies who get electricity in different ways.
