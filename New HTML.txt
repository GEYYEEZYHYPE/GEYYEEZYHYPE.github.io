     Chemical Energy and Fossil Fuels
<p> Lets start with chemical energy, have you ever thought what energy goes into my food? You probably thought protein,
fat, carbohydrates. But the energy stored in your food is chemical energy. Thats right, chemical energy. Chemical energy
can also be gasoline or even batteries. In things like homous, bread, pasta there is chemical energy. Moving onto fossil
fuels they make coal, methane, natural gas and petroleum. People say fossil fuels are bad, because they produce air pollu-
tants which makes carbon monoxide (which is poisonous) and sulfur dioxide (which can make acid) but that happens only to
burnt fossil fuels.
